Just a Solidity and Web3 enthusiast. Been in and out of the Web3 space for 3 1/2 years now. Not a pro, not a noob, somewhere in-between. Currently studying CompSci through Western Governors University, trying to work on various side-projects here and there to improve skills. Highly knowledgeable about the Solidity programming language and its quirks, and some elements of EVM architecture. Possesses proficiency in Python, C++, JavaScript, ReactJS, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. Primarily interested in Web3 and blockchain technology, not interested in "traditional" software development. Strong preference for startups and fast-paced development, though bills do need to get paid and jobs need to be worked on the weekends.
